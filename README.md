# Anime4k V4.0.1 hlsl obs shaders
These are Anime4k V4.0.1 hlsl shaders for obs to improve the quality of the preview and stream.

# Original shader that I modified can be found at [bloc97/Anime4k](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K/releases?q=v4.0.1&expanded=true)

## Information about these shaders:
Currently these shaders are being tested and do have issues.
I have only tested up to [3. Anime4K_Upscale_CNN_x2_VL18.effect](https://github.com/ryandash/Anime4k-obs-upscaling-shaders/blob/Update-to-V4.0.1/3.%20Anime4K_Upscale_CNN_x2_VL18.effect) where I have found my first 2 major issues.
These shaders are gpu hungry vs the original shaders causing obs to crash from gpu usage at this point and I need to find a way to convert some parts of the code that I do not currently know how to do.
